# student-winforms-project
This is a WinForms (.NET Framework) project developed using C#. It consists of a student form where student data can be entered and submitted. Functionalities like view, modify, delete, and save have also been included in the form. The student data is saved in the 'StudentData.csv' file. The student data can be sent to the server through TCP/IP socket configuration, and an acknowledgement is received back from the server. A HTTP POST request can be made to a server hosted in ASP.NET Web API with the student data, and a response is received from the server.
